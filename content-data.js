        title: 'Why Smart Analytics People Feel Stuck',
        shortDescription: 'Some of the smartest people I know in analytics feel stuck in situations that seem designed to waste their expertise. And the more people I talk to, the more this sounds like a normal experience.

        title: 'The Self-Service Analytics Myth',
        shortDescription: 'Understanding why "democratizing data" often creates more problems than it solves in most organizations. When teams lack shared context about how the business actually works, giving everyone access to data tools doesn\'t create alignmentâ€”it amplifies the existing dysfunction. The result is fragmented insights, competing narratives, and decision-making that optimizes individual departmental metrics while undermining overall organizational effectiveness.',

        shortDescription: 'Why treating your internal data platform like a consumer product is a recipe for failure.
